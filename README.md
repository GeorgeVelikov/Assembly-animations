This was one of the reasons I started reading more into graphical libraries. It was a stepping stone of sorts
This is part of a CS1520 Computer Architecture assignment in University of Aberdeen

In order to install it you would need TASM, I personally compiled the asm file through DOSBox
```
> tasm.exe CA8086.asm
> tlink.exe CA8086.obj
> CA8086.exe
```
The controls for the application are as follows:
- esc - exit program
- spacebar - change the shape
